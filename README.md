# An Example of Inheritance

## Description
This example will have three classes: `Person` will be the base class, and two classes will be derived from it: `Student` and `Teacher`.

## The first part

```c++
class Person{
private:
    string _name;
public:
    Person(const string& name);
    
    
};
```
